                    <p> In it's earlier days, basketball was a game where the 'big man' was typcially
                        the star of the show.  The game was slower in those days, with teams taking
                        their time to set up plays and work the ball into the center. Introduction of the shot
                        clock in 1954 doesn't seem to have affected this much, but strategy and style evolved
                        over the late 60's and 70's nonetheless, with guards ultimately taking 
                        the lead on points scored in the 2000's - especially with the boost that higher 
                        shooting percentage on three-pointers gave them.
                    </p>
                    <p>      
                        These are interesting times for the Centers once again... Lines are being blurred between
                        a player's position and his predetermined role in the game.  Centers are moving
                        around the court more, and the extraordinary height and athleticism of players 
                        joining the league from around the world is pushing the game in new directions.
                    </p>

                            Note: There was a lockout during the 1998-99 season, so only 50 games were 
                            played that year.
