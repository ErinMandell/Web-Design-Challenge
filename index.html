                    Basketball is a game that had humble beginnings in a YMCA gym in Massachusetts nearly 
                    130 years ago.  It was envisioned as an alternative to football, with the added benefit
                    of being played indoors during the winter months to allow for year-round conditioning.

                    This project takes a look at NBA players' stats over the past nearly 70 years to gain insight
                    into how the game has changed.  Not only have the rules been ammended numerous times as player
                    skill and strategy developed, but the players themselves have perhaps changed a bit too.

                    Points scored per player per game has changed,  but why?
                    The types of points scored has changed over time as well.
                    Are players in the NBA today younger than they used to be?      
                    Are they typically taller?
