                    <p> This graph is fun because it gives a glimpse into how the introduction of the 3 
                        point shot in 1980 eventually changed the scoring game.  It seems clear that the
                         decline in the average number of two-point shots per season was exascerbated by
                         the rising popularity of the three-pointer.

                        It took a number of years for three pointers to become the game changer that they 
                        are today, however.  Not only did teams need to adjust their game strategy to
                        embrace this new opportunity, but they also needed to get better at making it pay off.
                        Up until 1990, players were less than 20% effective with their three pointers,
                        but player skill consistently improved to ultimately arrive at the 30% accuracy rate
                        we see today.

                        Note: There was a lockout during the 1998-99 season, so only 50 games were 
                        played that year.
